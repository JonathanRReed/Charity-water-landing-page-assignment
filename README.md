# Charity: water — Landing Page (Class Assignment)

An accessible, beginner-friendly landing page inspired by charity: water. Built with semantic HTML and modern CSS only—no JavaScript—featuring a CSS-only donation modal flow.

## Features

- **CSS-only donation flow** using `:target` and `:has()` (no JS)
- **Custom donation amount** with currency prefix styling
- **Accessible forms** with labels, focus states, and ARIA attributes
- **Self‑hosted fonts** (Proxima Nova)
- **Responsive layout** with a modern, clean design

## Preview

Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Ensure the fonts and images in `Assests/` remain in place.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).

## Favicon

The favicon is set to `Assests/CW-favicon.jpg` in the document `<head>`. Update the file in `Assests/` to change it.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 only
- CSS selectors: `:target`, `:has()` for interactivity
